# Blockchain-Secured-Pension-System
The traditional pension system used currently is centralised. What this means is that the data is stored and controlled by a central server. Therefore, they are the governing body and if anything goes with it or any malpractice takes place within, the person to whom the data belongs cannot do anything about it because he/she is not the owner of the data if it is his/her own.   Using blockchain technology we are aiming to achieve decentralization of this data. Every individual will have complete ownership of their own data. Along with this the blockchain technology provides a high level of security. Blockchain uses the ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography) encryption algorithm to secure the data it contains. The data in blockchain cannot be hacked or tempered because the copy is maintained by all the members of the blockchain. So any change to take place is verified first by all the members of the block. It provides with CIA - Consistency, Integrity and Availability properties and this makes it reliable as well along with security.  We are designing an application that will save the pension data in the blockchain. The application front-end will be made using Flutter and smart contracts using Solidity. For the middleware we will be using web3.py or Moralis and use truffle/hardhat as development environment on local machine to show the prototype.
